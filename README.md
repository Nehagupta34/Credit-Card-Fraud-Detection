# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project was given by Akshay Rajput Sir. I have done this project by taking the help of geeks for geeks and kaggle. I have downloaded the dataset of .csv file of credit card from kaggle. 
This project lies main focus to recognize the fraudulent credit card transactions so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase. Enormous Data is processed every day and thus, the model used is simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as a fraudulent transaction as quickly as possible. In this project, I have build a Random Forest Model using skicit learn.
